    abstract = "The accurate attribution of scientific works to research organizations is hindered by the lack of openly available manually annotated data{--}in particular when multilingual and complex affiliation strings are considered. The AffilGood framework introduced in this paper addresses this gap. We identify three sub-tasks relevant for institution name disambiguation and make available annotated datasets and tools aimed at each of them, including i) a dataset annotated with affiliation spans in noisy automatically-extracted strings; ii) a dataset annotated with named entities for the identification of organizations and their locations; iii) seven datasets annotated with the Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifiers for the evaluation of entity-linking systems. In addition, we describe, evaluate and make available newly developed tools that use these datasets to provide solutions for each of the identified sub-tasks. Our results confirm the value of the developed resources and methods in addressing key challenges in institution name disambiguation."

	abstract = {Automatic recognition of affiliations in the metadata of scholarly publications is a key point for monitoring and analyzing trends in scientific production, especially in an open science context. We propose an automatic alignment method on registries, based on Elasticsearch. The proposed method is modular and leaves the choice of the alignment criteria to the user, allowing him to keep control over the precision and recall of the method. An implementation is proposed for an automatic alignment on three registries: countries, GRID.ac and RNSR (research laboratory directory in France) on the Github https://github.com/dataesr/matcher and the performances are analyzed in this paper.},
