	abstract = {Automatic recognition of affiliations in the metadata of scholarly publications is a key point for monitoring and analyzing trends in scientific production, especially in an open science context. We propose an automatic alignment method on registries, based on Elasticsearch. The proposed method is modular and leaves the choice of the alignment criteria to the user, allowing him to keep control over the precision and recall of the method. An implementation is proposed for an automatic alignment on three registries: countries, GRID.ac and RNSR (research laboratory directory in France) on the Github https://github.com/dataesr/matcher and the performances are analyzed in this paper.},

	title = {Content-based subject classification at article level in biomedical context},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14800},
	abstract = {Subject classification is an important task to analyze scholarly publications. In general, mainly two kinds of approaches are used: classification at a journal level and classification at the article level. We propose a mixed approach, leveraging on embeddings technique in NLP to train classifiers with article metadata (title, abstract, keywords in particular) labelled with the journal-level classification FoR (Fields of Research) and then apply these classifiers at the article level. We use this approach in the context of biomedical publications using metadata from Pubmed. Fasttext classifiers are trained with FoR codes and used to classify publications based on their available metadata. Results show that using a stratification sampling strategy for training help reduce the bias due to unbalanced field distribution. An implementation of the method is proposed on the repository https://github.com/dataesr/scientific\_tagger},

Our experiments show that our fast text classifier fastText is often on par with deep learning classifiers in terms of accuracy, and many orders of magnitude faster for training and evaluation. We can train fastText on more than one billion words in less than ten minutes using a standard multicore{\textasciitilde}CPU, and classify half a million sentences among{\textasciitilde}312K classes in less than a minute.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28\% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45\%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47\% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18\% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},
